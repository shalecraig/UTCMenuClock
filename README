This is an obscenely simple program to add the San Francisco time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as people I work with tend to
live in San Francisco. Converting in my head was a true pain.

The latest version is 1.2a for Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7 (Intel) downloadable from
GitHub in the Downloads section:

Compiled under XCode 4 and MacOS 10.7. It will run just fine in all
current MacOS versions, including Yosemite (10.10)

NOTE: After you install this software, you still have to run it to use it:   

Double-click "SFMenuClock" in your /Applications folder. If you want it to 
start automatically every time you log in , click on the clock in the menu 
bar and select "Open At Login"
